# ColourSquares

### Part 2: Coloured Squares *(Frontend)*

Create a basic web page where each of the 4 corners of the screen displays a coloured button (You pick the color for each corner!).

Next, create a display of 10 squares in the center of the page. When one of the 4 corner buttons is clicked, it automatically updates this list of 10 squares. The center squares always display the last 10 colours that were clicked. 

On page refresh, the list is **not** emptied.

You can use any UI library such as React, Redux, jQuery, or use vanilla Javascript.

Implementation:
using JQuery

how to test it:

open index.html file
